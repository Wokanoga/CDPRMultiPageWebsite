          CD Projekt was founded in May 1994 by Marcin Iwiński and Michał Kiciński. According to Iwiński, 
          although he enjoyed playing video games as a child they were scarce in Poland (which was in the 
          Soviet Union's sphere of influence at the time). Polish copyright law did not exist and Iwiński, 
          in high school, sold cracked copies of Western video games at a Warsaw marketplace. In high 
          school Iwiński met Kiciński, who became his business partner; at that time, Kiciński also sold video 
          games.
